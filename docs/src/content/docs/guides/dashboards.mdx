# Dashboards as Visual Workspaces

Dashboards act as versatile visual workspaces where you can organize and manage multiple visualizations related to your projects. They provide a dynamic and interactive environment for exploring, analyzing, and presenting data effectively.

## Dashboard Data Structure

To represent a dashboard in your system, you can use the following `DashboardData` interface:

```typescript
{{Layout}}

{{DashboardData}}

{{DashboardType}}

```
### Key Attributes

- **name:** A unique identifier for the dashboard.
- **projectName:** The name of the associated project for contextual linking.
- **description:** An optional field providing additional context or details about the dashboard.
- **createdAt:** The timestamp indicating when the dashboard was created.
- **updatedAt:** The timestamp showing the last modification of the dashboard.
- **visualizations:** A collection of visualizations included in the dashboard, either as key-value pairs or an array of visualization types.
- **layouts:** A list of layout configurations that determine the position and size of visualizations within the dashboard. Each layout includes:
  - **i:** A unique identifier for the visualization.
  - **x, y:** Coordinates representing the visualization's position on the grid.
  - **w, h:** The width and height of the visualization.
  - **minW, minH:** Minimum width and height constraints.

### Dashboard Features

Dashboards enable users to:

- Drag and drop visualizations to rearrange them in the workspace.
- Resize visualizations to fit specific data needs.
- Maintain multiple layouts to cater to different use cases or audiences.

By offering such flexibility, dashboards empower users to customize their visual workspaces according to the project's requirements.
