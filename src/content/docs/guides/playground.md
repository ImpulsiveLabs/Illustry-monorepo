Illustry offers a powerful Data Playground, allowing users to interactively test and visualize their JSON data before saving it. This feature is designed to provide a convenient and efficient way to see how different visualizations would look with your specific dataset. The playground also includes a data validation mechanism to ensure that your JSON conforms to the expected structure.
