# Project as a Workspace

In this system, a project serves as the fundamental building block, acting as a dedicated workspace for your endeavors. Each project encapsulates the essential elements of your work, providing a structured environment for data visualization and analysis.

## Project Data Structure

To represent a project in your system, you can use the following `ProjectData` interface:

```typescript
interface ProjectData {
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  createdAt?: Date;
  updatedAt?: Date;
  isActive?: boolean;
}
```
### Key Attributes

- **name:** A unique identifier for the project.
- **description:** An optional field to provide additional context or details about the project.
- **createdAt:** The timestamp indicating when the project was initially created.
- **updatedAt:** The timestamp indicating the last modification of the project.
- **isActive:** A boolean flag specifying whether the project is currently active.

## Project Activation

It's important to note that only one project can be active at a given time. This ensures a focused and organized workspace, allowing users to concentrate on a specific project and its associated visualizations.

By structuring your work in this manner, you create a cohesive and manageable environment for your projects, facilitating efficient data analysis and visualization within a dedicated workspace.
