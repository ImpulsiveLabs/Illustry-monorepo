The **Line Chart** visualization is a versatile tool for representing trends and patterns in numerical data over time. It is widely used for visualizing the relationship between two continuous variables and highlighting trends or fluctuations.

## Line Chart Data Structure

To represent a Line Chart, you can use the following `AxisChartData` interface:

```typescript
export interface AxisChartData {
  headers: string[];
  values: { [key: string]: number[] };
}
```
### Key Attributes

- **headers:** An array of strings representing the categories or dimensions along one of the axis.
- **values:** A dictionary where each key is a category or dimension, and the corresponding value is an array of numerical values along the other axis. 


### Pros and Cons

#### Pros
- **Multi-Dimensional Comparison:** Line Charts excel at comparing multiple dimensions simultaneously, providing a comprehensive view of the data.

- **Clear Value Representation:** Numerical values are clearly represented along both the X and Y axes, making it easy for users to interpret and compare.

#### Cons
- **Complexity with Excessive Categories:** When dealing with a large number of categories or dimensions, the visualization may become crowded and challenging to interpret.

- **Limited for Categorical Data:** Line Charts are most effective for numerical data and may not be the optimal choice for representing categorical data.
